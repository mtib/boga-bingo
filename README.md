## Play it now!

You can play it here: [Scammer Bingo V2](https://mtib.github.io/boga-bingo/bingo.html#). If you encounter any errors or find typos please create an Issue about it, or create a merge request fixing it.

## Background

The official [Scammer Bingo](http://kitboga.com/bingo) was outdated. So I felt like making a completely new one with newer web technologies, while listening to the stream. I am not affiliated with Kitboga, I am just a (somewhat new) viewer of his who got bored and made a game. The idea for this game is also not mine, as he has his own version with fewer options.

## Contributing

If you see an opportunity to improve this game, feel free to shoot me a pull request or and issue describing the change you want. Though I reserve my right to decide what makes it into the game and what doesn't.
