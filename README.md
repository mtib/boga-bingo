# Play it now!

You can play the latest version of `boga-bingo` here: [Scammer Bingo V2](https://mtib.github.io/boga-bingo/bingo.html#).

If you encounter any errors or find typos please create an Issue about it, or create a merge request fixing it. Have a look at the "Contributing" part of this document for more information.

I already took action to get Kitboga's attention, as I would be honoured if he decided to link to this version of the game. I appreciate if you like this project, but try not to spam any of his contact channels about it.

## Background

The official [Scammer Bingo](http://kitboga.com/bingo) was outdated, so I decided to make a completely new one with newer web technologies, while listening to the stream. I am not affiliated with Kitboga, I am just a (somewhat new) viewer of his who got bored and made a game. The idea for this game is also not mine, as he has his own version with fewer options.

## Contributing

If you see the opportunity to improve this game, feel free to shoot me a pull request or an issue describing the change you want. Though I reserve my right to decide what makes it into the game and what doesn't.

There are some design goals that I try to uphold while changing this application.

- The bingo options should work for multiple types of scam
- It should not contain references to content new viewers wouldn't know
- Its language should follow Kitboga's twitch stream style
  - Avoid swear words whenever possible
- There shouldn't be duplicates of bingo options
  - Have a look at the `selector` function to define exclusive options
- It should stay easy to extend / change
